var sparkysAge = 4; //sparkysage is 4
var age = sparkysAge * 7; //multiplying dog years by human years

//Slice of pie part 1
//How much pizza each party goer will get

const pizzaSlices = 8; // 8 slices per pizza
var partyPeople = 20; // 20 total people at the party
var pizzaBought = 6; // 6 total pizzas for the party

// pizzas bought divided by amount of people divided by the amount of people

var slicePer = pizzaBought * pizzaSlices / partyPeople;

console.log("each person ate" + " " + slicePer + " " + "slices of pizza at the party") // Partygoers will get 2 slices of pizza

//slice of pie part 2
//how much pizza will sparky get using modulo

var remainder = 48 % 20;
console.log("sparky got" + " " + remainder + " " + "slices of pizza")
